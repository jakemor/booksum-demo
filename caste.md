# Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents

### By Isabel Wilkerson

# Toxicity of Caste and the 2016 Election

Imagine the earth beneath your feet, seemingly stable, suddenly quaking, revealing silent earthquakes that had long been brewing. The 2016 U.S. presidential election was such a seismic event, unearthing the hidden fractures within American society. It was a moment that exposed the persistence of deep-rooted prejudices, akin to the reactivation of ancient pathogens in the Siberian tundra. The resurgence of human pathogens like hatred and tribalism became evident as the nation witnessed a rise in hate crimes and mass violence. This election was not just about political parties; it was a manifestation of America's social dynamics, a reflection of the caste system that has silently shaped the contours of this nation. The opposition party faced challenges akin to maintaining an old house, where ignoring the issues only leads to further deterioration. As the demographic shifts in the United States continue to alter the face of the dominant racial caste, the election and its aftermath serve as a stark reminder that the toxins of caste are not easily eradicated. They lie dormant, waiting for the right conditions to reemerge and disrupt the surface of our collective consciousness.

# The American Caste System

Caste is the infrastructure of our divisions, an unseen hierarchy that dictates the positioning of individuals within society. In America, this system is as old as the country itself, with deep-rooted divisions and hierarchies that have shaped our history and present. The American caste system, like the ancient foundations of an old house, underlies the conscious world we see. It is about power, resources, and assumptions of competence, guiding our unconscious ranking of human characteristics. Race serves as the visible cue to one's caste in America, a marker of status and belonging. Martin Luther King Jr. recognized this during his visit to India, where he saw parallels between the American racial hierarchy and the Indian caste system. The historical evolution of the American caste system is a tale of power, control, and the maintenance of a status quo that benefits the dominant caste. Its presence is enduring, its impact profound, shaping the lives and destinies of all who reside within this nation.

# Historical Parallels in Caste Systems

The American South's legal caste system and India's ancient social hierarchy are not as disparate as they may seem. Both systems have marginalized groups, creating a rigid structure that impacts every aspect of society. My journey to understand the American caste system led me to draw parallels with India's caste system and the one imposed in Nazi Germany. These systems, though separated by oceans and eras, share a common thread of oppression and hierarchy. Interactions with Indian scholars and individuals from different castes revealed the pervasive nature of caste dynamics. The metaphor of 'The Matrix' aptly describes the impact of awareness and resistance on challenging societal hierarchies. Once we recognize the invisible forces that shape our perceptions and interactions, we can begin to dismantle the structures that confine us and work towards a more equitable society.

# The Matrix of Caste

The matrix of caste is an invisible prison, one that many do not even realize they inhabit. It is a system that emerged in America with the arrival of Africans in the English colonies in 1619, institutionalizing slavery and dehumanizing an entire race. The brutal realities of slavery, the inhumane treatment of enslaved individuals, and the lasting impact of this system on American society are scars that remain visible to this day. Acknowledging and confronting this dark chapter is essential for healing and justice. The matrix of caste is not just a relic of the past; it continues to shape the present, influencing our interactions and the very fabric of American life. It is a system that must be recognized, understood, and ultimately dismantled if we are to move forward as a truly united nation.

# The Visceral Experience of Caste

The visceral experience of caste is one of brutal exploitation and dehumanization. African-Americans, throughout history, have been subjected to a caste system that has dictated their roles, their worth, and their place in society. This system has been reinforced by violence, discrimination, and the enduring effects of slavery. The role of immigrants in this system, and the ways in which the dominant caste has maintained its power, are threads that run deep in the fabric of American society. The dehumanizing treatment of African-Americans, the impact of Jim Crow laws, and the perspectives of individuals like the Nigerian-born playwright on racial identity, all serve to highlight the deep-rooted racial hierarchy that has shaped, and continues to shape, the American landscape.

# The Consequences of Caste

The consequences of caste are far-reaching and profound. The story of Miss Hale and her father, Harold Hale, who challenged the caste system by demanding respect through his daughter's name, is a testament to the personal impact of this invisible hierarchy. My own experiences as a national correspondent, facing discrimination, further illustrate how caste can lead to dehumanization and prejudice. The hypothetical scenario of two groups with different physical traits encountering each other underscores the arbitrary nature of human characteristics and the impact of power dynamics. Caste's pervasive influence has consequences that ripple through individuals' lives and society as a whole, shaping destinies and dictating opportunities based on perceived social standing.

# The Intrusions of Caste

Caste intrudes upon our lives in ways both overt and subtle. It is a concept that intertwines with race and racism, shaping our historical origins and perpetuating inequality. The categorization of humans based on arbitrary traits such as height or skin color is a social construct that creates illogical divisions. The evolution of racism and the complexities of identifying it in contemporary society are challenges that we must confront. Caste's enduring influence as a system of ranking affects interactions and opportunities, calling for a deeper understanding of its pervasive impact in our quest for a more egalitarian world.

# Backlash and the Future of Caste

The future of caste is intertwined with our willingness to confront and dismantle this insidious system. The parallels between the caste systems in India and America, the resistance and shared experiences of oppressed groups, and the Nazis' interest in the United States' racial purity laws all point to the global and historical significance of caste. The discussions among Nazi officials in 1934, admiring America's racial hierarchy, underscore the power and reach of caste systems. As we analyze caste and its enduring impact, we must also consider its intersection with race in different societies and the importance of resistance in shaping a future free from the constraints of this ancient and powerful system.
